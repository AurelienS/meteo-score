    "howItWorks": "How Meteo Score Works",
    "howItWorksDesc": "Meteo Score objectively evaluates weather forecast model accuracy by comparing forecast predictions against real-world observations from weather beacons and stations. This helps paragliding pilots and outdoor enthusiasts understand which forecasts are most reliable for their specific flying sites.",
    "metricsExplained": "Metrics Explained",
    "mae": "Mean Absolute Error (MAE)",
    "maeFormula": "MAE = Average(|Forecast - Observation|)",
    "maeDesc": "MAE measures the average magnitude of forecast errors. Lower is better. For example, an MAE of 4.2 km/h for wind speed means the model is typically off by approximately 4.2 km/h in either direction.",
    "biasTitle": "Bias (Systematic Error)",
    "biasFormula": "Bias = Average(Forecast - Observation)",
    "positiveBias": "Positive bias:",
    "positiveBiasDesc": "Model systematically overestimates (e.g., predicts stronger wind than actually observed)",
    "negativeBias": "Negative bias:",
    "negativeBiasDesc": "Model systematically underestimates (e.g., predicts weaker wind than actually observed)",
    "zeroBias": "Zero bias:",

    "dataCollectionStep3": "Forecasts are matched with observations within a 30-minute window",
    "dataCollectionStep4": "Deviation is calculated: Forecast Value - Observed Value",
    "dataCollectionStep5": "Aggregate metrics (MAE, Bias) are computed from 90+ days of historical deviations",
